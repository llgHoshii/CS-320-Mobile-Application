#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure the code is functional and secure by testing it in JUnit. I use logic to create the methods and test them accordingly ensuring they run as expected with different inputs.
As an example, I make the program take an integer input to erase a contact and if the input in in the map it will erase the contact, if not it will give an illegal argument.

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret the users’ needs based on the requirements given to me. I then proceeded to think about which is the best way to integrate them logically into the code, using different data structures or algorithms. As an example in the appointment object I was asked to make appointments before a certain date invalid, for this i used a variable today with the date and compared the appointments dates with a get method, if the date is valid it is accepted else an illegal argument is thrown.

#How do I approach designing software?
After my initial mistakes with the logic behind the software I have learned to think about it in a different way. I now opt to make sure code can be ran successfully multiple times along with accepting different inputs which I specify in the methods parameters. I also make sure the Junit tests are logical and test the features being added by calling the service or object. I also try and stick to the requirements needed for the software. At the beginning I would overcomplicate myself adding things that were not asked for in the requirements.
I have also learned to designing software in increments. At the beginning I would sit down and try to write it all, causing me problems when I couldn’t solve a user requirement or when bugs showed up when trying to run it. I now write a few lines of code and test it along with taking breaks between coding sessions to come back with fresh eyes and a fresh mindset.
